New changes are covered in CHANGELOG.md

v3.2.0  --  2017.03.31
* On overlapped async match calls, we cancel (reject) those shadowed instead of returning false
  (this gave wrong message to higher level logic)

v3.1.0  --  2017.03.27
* Introduce `promiseResultImplementation` option, thanks to which we can ensure consistent result
  types

v3.0.0  --  2017.03.20
* Support asynchronous `match` (it may now return promise)
* Do not try/catch eventual controller crashes (to avoid broken stack trace's).
  Instead of on error, expose the route details on router instance

v2.0.0  --  2015.06.25
* Convert utility into more natural ControllerRouter class form
* Improve specifity handling in dynamic routes resolution
* Improve documentation
* Rename internal modules to more corresponding names
* Modularize configuration resolution, so it can be adapted by extensions

v1.0.0  --  2015.06.23
* Initial
